	  <p> Swap is an Oberlin-based cooperative for books. The idea is simple: you have books that you don't want or use anymore, so exchange them for new books. For every book you donate, you get credit. Using that credit, you can get new books that you're looking for, i.e. that expensive Bio textbook.</p>
	  <p> Anyone can become a member of Swap. We're still in the preliminary stages, but come Fall 2013 we'll have positions open for members who want to help out. Members who help out can get credit for the hours that they work, which can then be used to get books.</p>	  
	  <p> By clicking the sign up button below and entering in a valid email address, you'll be able to get on our mailing list. We'll contact you about events in the future, as well as let you know when we're starting up in the Fall!</p>

	<p>Our mission is to make knowledge free and accessible by creating and sustaining a cooperative to exchange, share, and recycle books. We strive to do so democratically, sustainably, and equitably with an emphasis on member participation. </p>
	
	<p>We recognize education as a human right. We seek to make traditional education more financially accessible by allowing member labor to be exchanged for textbooks and other material goods. We recognize that there are many kinds of education, and we seek to facilitate grassroots learning outside of the academy through community exchange of skills, knowledge, and experience.</p>
	
	<p>Our organization is not for profit. Rather than allowing a select few to accumulate surplus value and control surplus labor, our goal is to share the surplus equitably among members. We operate off of volunteer member labor and our store is stocked through donations.</p>
